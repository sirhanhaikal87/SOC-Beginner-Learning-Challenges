## **Preparation: Lab Setup**  
### **Requirements**  
- **Target Machine:** Windows 10/11 (System from which the forensic image will be acquired).  
- **Analysis Machine (Optional):** Windows or Linux (System where the image will be stored and analyzed).  
- **Tools Required:**  
  - **FTK Imager** (Forensic Toolkit by AccessData)  
  - **External Storage Device** (if required for storing the forensic image)  
- **User Permissions:** Administrator privileges on the Windows target machine.

## **Forensic Acquisition Steps**  

### **Step 1: Download and Install FTK Imager**
1. Download **FTK Imager** from the official AccessData website:  
   [https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager)  
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### **Step 2: Launch FTK Imager and Select Evidence Source**
1. Open **FTK Imager** as an administrator.  
2. Click on **File → Create Disk Image**.  
3. Choose the **source type**:  
   - **Physical Drive** (for a full disk image).  
   - **Logical Drive** (for a specific partition).  
   - **Folder or File** (for selected files only).  
4. Click **Next** and select the target disk or partition.

### **Step 3: Configure Image Destination and Format**
1. Choose the **Image Type**:  
   - **E01 (Expert Witness Format)** (Recommended for forensic analysis).  
   - **RAW (dd format)** (For compatibility with Linux-based tools).  
   - **SMART or AFF** (Other forensic formats).  
2. Click **Next** and enter the following details:  
   - **Case Number**  
   - **Evidence Number**  
   - **Investigator Name**  
   - **Additional Notes (if needed)**  
3. Select a destination folder where the image will be saved.  
4. Click **Next** and choose **Enable Compression** (Optional, for reducing file size).  
5. Select **Verify Image After Creation** to ensure integrity.  

---

### **Step 4: Start the Imaging Process**
1. Click **Start** to begin acquiring the forensic image.  
2. Monitor the progress in FTK Imager.  
3. Once completed, FTK Imager will generate a **hash value (MD5/SHA1)** for verification.  

---

### **Step 5: Verify the Integrity of the Forensic Image**
1. Compare the **MD5 or SHA1 hash** generated by FTK Imager with the source disk.  
2. Run the following command in Windows Command Prompt (if needed for verification):  
   ```powershell
   certutil -hashfile "C:\path\to\image.E01" MD5
   ```
3. Ensure the hash matches to confirm the image is forensically sound.

## Conclusion
✅ Successfully created a forensic image of a Windows machine using FTK Imager.   
✅ Ensured data integrity using hashing methods.   
✅ Stored the forensic image securely for further analysis using tools like Autopsy, Volatility, or EnCase.   
✅ Learned how digital forensics analysts perform forensic acquisitions for investigations.    

## Submission
- Share a screenshot of FTK Imager showing the completed forensic image creation.
- Share a screenshot of the hash verification result.
- Write a short observation on how forensic imaging ensures evidence integrity and supports incident response investigations.
